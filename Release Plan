Team Hipster Release Plans for SlugSearch

High Level Goals: We want to provide the ultimate mobile companion app to the student portal website by providing users with better UI, push notifications alerts when a certain full class becomes open and ability to see class/professor ratings with RateMyProfessor.

Sprint 1 – 
User Story 1: Working but rough UI that can be viewed in both Android SDK and iOS SDK~8 hours. 
User Story 2: Successfully creating the web crawler that crawls every hour for open classes ~8 hours. 

Sprint 2 – 
User Story 1: Redefine UI and implement design ~16 hours (This is the bulk of the product and includes the creation of easier search queries, responsive design and a back to search button). 
This sprint will also require the most planning and discussion in terms of the exact direction we want to go in.

Sprint 3 – 
User Story 1: Improving the product by providing amazing features that will give students who download the app an advantage in signing up for classes. 
              This will include a Watch Class feature that will send push notifications for when the class is nearing full capacity and for whenever a spot opens up ~8 hours. 
User Story 2: Also we will try to get RatemyProfessor integrated but at the very least I would hope we will have a hyperlink that will perform a search on ratemyprofessor to find the teacher for a specific class ~8 hours.

Total of 48 hours

Product Backlog:
Unlikely unless we have a lot of time - 
User Profiles to store classes (keep in mind we cannot add these stored classes without being in the school portal therefore feature is not necessary).
Course schedule to image file creator (Again this faces the same problem in that we cannot import student portal schedules).
We cannot access the student center of the UCSC portal as we are limited by not being able to get the myUCSC API.
